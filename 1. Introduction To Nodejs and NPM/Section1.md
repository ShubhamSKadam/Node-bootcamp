### SYNCHRONOUS VS. ASYNCHRONOUS CODE (BLOCKING VS. NON-BLOCKING)

#### Synchronous Code :

Below is an example of Synchronous code.

<img src="Notes-Img/p1.png" alt="p1" style="zoom:30%;" />

It's your job to avoid this type of situation.

<img src="Notes-Img\N1.png" alt="N1" style="zoom:30%;" />

#### Asynchronous Code :

Below is an example of Asynchronous code.

<img src="Notes-Img\p2.png" alt="p2" style="zoom:30%;" />

Non Blocking I/O model :

<img src="Notes-Img\N2.png" alt="N2" style="zoom:30%;" />
